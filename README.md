# BayesFlow: And extension of BayesDiff to Flow matching

... Some nice plots here ...

## ðŸ§ª Running the Project

- Create the virtual environment

```bash
 python3.12 -m venv .venv
```

- Activate the environment

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

- Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Train the model
  > From the root of the directory

The following is just an example to get all options you can run: `python -m src.train.run --help`

```bash
python -m src.train.run --epochs 20 --method=diffusion
```

This will log results to wanbd if enabled. Keep in mind that you have to add your api key inside a `.env` file in the root of the repo. You can take inspiration from `.env_sample`

- You can also run a model to generate images:
  > The following is an example which use the best_model checkpoint to generate images inside the checkpoint directory by default

```bash
python -m src.eval.generate --n 10
```

### To get all the plots

> You first need to train the model and then run the general script

```bash
./generate_llla_samples.sh
```

### Additional results

Write some code inspired by the paper to use a better pre-trained model to showcase some nice results
